I'm calling because I'm having issues with my medical bill I just received few days ago. It's incorrect and it does not match the numbers I was presented before my medical procedure. Agent: I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir. Could you please tell me your phone number and your full name? Client: Yes, sure. My number is 011-4567-8910 and my name is Martín Pérez. Agent: Thank you, Mr. Pérez. I'm going to check your plan, you deduction limits and current year transactions towards your deductions. One moment, please. Client: Okay, thank you. Agent: Mr. Pérez, I've reviewed your plan and I see that you have the Silver basic plan of $3,000 deductable. Is that correct? Client: Yes, that's correct. Agent: Well, I would like to inform you that you have not met your deductible yet and $2,800 of the procedure will be still be your responsability and that will meet your deductible for the year. Client: What? How is that possible? I paid over $2,000 already towards my deductable this year, I should only be $1,000 away from reaching my deductible not $2,800.  Agent: I understand, Mr. Pérez. But keep in mind that not all fees your pay to doctors and labs and medications count towards your deductible.  Client: Well, but they didn't explain that to me when I contracted the plan. They told me that everything I pay from my pocket towards doctors, specialists, labs and medications will count towards my deductable. I feel cheated. Agent: I apologize, Mr. Pérez. It was not our intention to deceive you. If you think the deductable is too high, I recommed changing the plan to Gold at the next renewal window and that will bring the deductable to $1,000 for the new year. Client: And how much would that cost me? Agent: The plan rates will come out in November, you can call us back then or check the new rates online at that time. Client: Mmm, I don't know. Isn't there another option? Can't you reduce the amount I have to pay for this bill as I was not explained how the deductible work correctly? Agent: I'm sorry, Mr. Pérez. I don't have the power to change the bill or your deductible under the current Silver plan. Client: Well, let me think about it. Can I call later to confirm? Agent: Of course, Mr. Pérez. You can call whenever you want. The number is the same one you dialed now. Is there anything else I can help you with? Client: No, that's all. Thank you for your attention. Agent: Thank you, Mr. Pérez. Have a good day. Goodbye."

##### 1) Create a new feature branch

1. In order to do that, run the following bash script.

    ```bash
    cd llmops-project
    
    echo "> Creating a feature branch"
    git checkout -b feature-ABCD
    
    echo "> Pushing the development branch to the remote repository"
    git push origin feature-ABCD
    ```

2. Change something in your flow.

    In this step, make a change in the `entity_extraction` flow, such as renaming one of the nodes.

3. Update feature branch.

    In order to update the feature branch, run the following bash script.

    ```bash
    cd llmops-project
    git add .
    git commit -m "updating config"
    git push origin feature-ABCD
    ```

4. Create a Pull Request from the feature branch to the development branch.

    Go to the project repository on GitHub.com to create the pull request.

    Compare the branch to the base development branch, then select **Create pull request**.

    After creating the Pull Request, you will notice that the Pull Request flow has been initiated.

    ![The "Some checks haven't completed yet" message on the pull request flow is highlighted.](images/lab6grab15.png)

5. Review and approve the PR for the new feature once all checks complete within the Pull Request flow.

    ![The "Merge pull request" button is highlighted.](images/lab6grab16.png)

6. Check CI pipeline execution.

    Check the execution of the CI pipeline in the GitHub actions option:

    * Select the **Actions** on the repository page.
    * select the pipeline that is in progress or has already been completed.

    ![The running action in the Actions page is displayed.](images/lab6grab17.png)

7. Check CD pipeline execution.

    Check the execution of the deployment pipeline in the GitHub actions option. Wait until the pipeline action successfully completes.

    Select each of the pipelines to view the log and the artifacts with the results of the evaluations.

    Congratulations, all exercises are now complete!

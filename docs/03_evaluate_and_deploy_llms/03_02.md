##### 1) Deploy the RAG flow to an online managed endpoint

Open the **Multi-Round Q&A on Your Data** flow that you created in the previous exercise.

After opening the flow, follow the instructions:

1.	Have a prompt flow ready for deployment. If you don't have one, see how to build a prompt flow.
   
2.	Optional: Select Chat to test if the flow is working correctly. Testing your flow before deployment is recommended best practice.
   
3.	Select Deploy on the flow editor.

4.	Provide the requested information on the Basic Settings page in the deployment wizard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you receive an error like the one below stating "Out Of Quota - No enough cluster CPU quota", you can request a quota increase or just reduce the `instance count` to 2 instead of 3 and try the deployment again.

5.	Select Review + Create to review the settings and create the deployment. Otherwise you can select Next to proceed to the advanced settings pages.
    
6.	Select Create to deploy the prompt flow.
